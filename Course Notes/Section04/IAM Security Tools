# IAM Security Tools

## The IAM Credentials Report (account-level)

- A report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials.

## IAM Access Advisor (user-level)

- Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.

* You can use this information to revise policies.

## Using IAM Credentials Report

In the AWS Console, go IAM => Credential Report. This will download a CSV with all the data.

## Using Access Advisor

Go IAM => Users => UserName => Access Advisor Tab.

What you get is a list of services accessed by this user along with some data about how and when. Useful.

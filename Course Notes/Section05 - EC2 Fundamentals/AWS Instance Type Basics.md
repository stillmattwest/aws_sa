# AWS Instance Type Basics

Different types of EC2 instances are optimized for different use cases.

The come in various families:

* The letter in the name is the *instance class*.

* The number following the letter is the *instance generation*.

* The descriptor following the dot is a measure of the *instance size*. 


## General Purpose Instances

* Great for a range of workloads such as web servers or code repositories

* Balance between compute, memory, and networking

* the t class are general purpose instances.


## Compute Optimized

* Batch Processing Workloads

* Media Transcoding

* High Performance Web Servers

* Scientific Modeling and Machine Learning

* Dedicated gaming servers

* The C Class Instances are compute optimized.

## Memory Optimized

* High-performance, in-memory databases

* Distributed web scale cache stores

* DBs optimized for BI work

* Real time processing of big, unstructured data.

* The R, X, High-Memory, and Z classes are all Memory Optimized.

## Storage Opimized

Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets on local storage.

* Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)

* Relational and No-SQL databases

* Cache for in-memory databases (Redis, etc)

* Data warehousing applications

* Distributed file systems

* The i, D, and H classes are storage opimized.

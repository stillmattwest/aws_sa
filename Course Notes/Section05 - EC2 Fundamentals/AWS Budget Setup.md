# AWS Budget Setup

You can set budgets and alarms for when you go over budget.

By default, only the root user has access to billing. 

To fix that, go root user => Account => IAM access to billing. This allows any IAM user with Admin access to see billing info.

Once allowed, you should be able to navigate to the Bill and Cost Management Home Page.

There is also a free tier page that will help predict if you're going to stay on track for free usage.

At the Budget menu, you can set a budget for the account.

Budgets have templates, including a zero-spend template.

Another option is a monthly cost budget, where you can set a maximum spend per month. 

Alerts can be set at various percentages of the max spend. Those can be sent by email.

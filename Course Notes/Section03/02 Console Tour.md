# AWS Console Tour

This section has an overview of the AWS Console, which changes over time. But most settings are available here.

You can access services either via the search menu icon or via the search bar.

There is also a fair amount of training material (blogs, etc) when you search for a feature.

You can also look up AWS Regional Services, which lists all the services available in a given region.

There have been some UI changes from the time of recording the video and today. There is a section (section 3) that describes some of these changes but they are actively being made by Amazon so expect more of them. 

There is a toggle that allows you switch back to the old UI but its probably best not to use that.

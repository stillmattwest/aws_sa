# AWS Overview

AWS is divided into regions like us-west-2, etc. 

## How to choose a region

* Compliance
* Latency
* Available Services (not all services available in all regions)
* Pricing (can vary between regions)

## Availability Zones

Each region has many availability zones (AZ).

Each AZ is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power. 

The AZs are separate from each other so they are isolated from disasters.

The AZs are connected with high-bandwidth connections

## Points of Presence (Edge Locations)

* 400+ PoPs in 90+ cities across 40+ countries
* Content delivered via edge locations
